# Nuke JS

A Firefox addon that nukes JS by domain. After launching the nuke, cache and cookies are evaporated for the domain, and JavaScript is gone, too. If you feel bad, you can un-nuke the domain the same way you nuked it; by clicking the extension's action button.

This extension is very simple, and therefore does not have any options. There are no plans to add any.
